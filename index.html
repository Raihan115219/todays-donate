              As the victims' livelihoods have been damaged, it is a foremost
              thing to provide relief and support. Rehabilitation of the
              affected households in the villages will ensure that these
              families come out of the calamity. Their lives will be renewed and
              their children will be able to go back to school. The displaced
              families will get back their lives in terms of rebuilding their
              home, scope for earning to ensure food support and protect them
              from further deterioration.
